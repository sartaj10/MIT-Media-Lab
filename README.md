# Smart Physio

SmartPhysio is an application to aid beginners in physio training at home by tracking userâ€™s movements in real-time and guiding them, using a simple webcam. This was developed as part of the weeklong MIT Media Lab Design Innovation Workshop held at Gujarat, India.

The project makes use of OpenCV and Python to track the user's movements using Color Recognition.
